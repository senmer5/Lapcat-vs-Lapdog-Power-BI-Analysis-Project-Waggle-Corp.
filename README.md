# Power BI Project – Lapcat 🐱 vs. Lapdog 🐶 Analysis

---
## 📘 Scenario
You are a **Business Intelligence Analyst** at **Waggle**, a pet technology startup. Waggle recently launched **Lapdog** , a smart dog collar that:
- Tracks steps 
- Sends walking reminders 
- Repels fleas 

The product received **excellent reviews**, sales are increasing, and most importantly, it works!

Encouraged by this success, the CEO is considering a **similar product for cats – Lapcat **. To test its viability, the product team distributed **1,000 Lapcat prototypes**. After months of data collection, your task is to **analyze the results and create a Power BI report comparing Lapcat to Lapdog**.

Your report will be presented to **top management**, so your insights will help the CEO determine if Lapcat is the next big success or a costly mistake.
